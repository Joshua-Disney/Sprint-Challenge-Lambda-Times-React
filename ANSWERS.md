PropTypes are used to remind ourselves and let future developers working on our code know what type of element each prop passed down from state is and if it is required in order to make the application run properly.  This way we know when we're working with objects vs. strings or numbers etc. If the proptypes are wrong it could throw errors in the console so that they can easily be found and fixed.
A react life-cycle event is an event that is triggered only when specific conditions have been met, such as componentDidMount() which only runs AFTER the first render.  Adding in these life-cycle events help us control when data is rendered or updated.
A Higher Order Component takes in another component as an argument and alters it by giving it additional functionality.  This could be anthing from uppercasing the text in a component or chosing between multiple components which one to render to the DOM.
Three of the different ways to style components are vanilla CSS, a less or sass pre-compiler, or by using styled-components.  Vanilla CSS helps keep track of each element being styled and updates the page immediately with the new styling.  A compiler allows us to add nested sytling for even more specificity.  Styled-components allows us to write all of our styling inside the .js files themselves so that we don't need additional .css files in our codebase.
